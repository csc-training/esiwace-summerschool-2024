## Work sharing for vector addition

Implement element-wise vector addition, i.e. C = A + B, in parallel using OpenMP work
sharing.

Starting from a skeleton code, add the missing loop for the vector addition, enclose it 
in a parallel region with appropriate work (and data!) sharing directives. Try with different
numbers of threads.
