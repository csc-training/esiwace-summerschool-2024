# Explainable AI (XAI)

- XAI aims to make the models, predictions, and decision-making processes of AI systems transparent, interpretable, and explainable

- Transparency: how an AI model works; understanding the features and data that the model uses to make decisions

- Interpretability: why a model made a certain prediction or decision (understandability)

- Explainable: understanding the model predictions as a whole

# Different XAI techniques

- Feature importance analysis (which features have the most influence on the model's decisions

- Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME): Generating explanations for individual predictions

- Shapley values: A game theory-based approach to understanding feature contributions.

- Rule-based models: Creating models that make decisions based on easily understandable rules.
