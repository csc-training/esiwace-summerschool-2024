# Part 5: Remaining challenges

# Remaining challenges
- What do you think the biggest challenges are in:
	- Numerical Weather Prediction?
   -  Earth System modelling? 
 
- Discuss with the people next to you

# Remaining challenges
- Many extreme events occur on small scales are our models do not resolve them well
- To have higher resolution models, requires more computing power - or more computationally efficient models
- Including more and more processes increases computational cost
- Almost all NWP and ESM models are written in Fortran
