#

All models are wrong, but some are useful.

George Box, 1976

# What is our model good at?

* We want to use the model to learn about the climate system.
* We might want to learn about the future, where there are no observations.
* We might want to learn about the past, where observations are scarce.
* Where can we trust the model / where rather not?

# The difficulty of comparing to reality
* There is substantial climate variability, even on longer time scales.
* We don't know for which quantity our reality is on which end of the variability spectrum.
* We don't know for which quantity our simulation is on which end of the variability spectrum.
* We call the path of a simulation through the space of possible weathers the **trajectory**.

# The free-running model
* We don't expect the model to get the weather right, but the climate, i.e. the **statistics** of the weather.
* We can't directly compare to weather observations.
* Climate is changing fast.

What should we do?

# The free-running model
* We don't expect the model to get the weather right, but the climate, i.e. the **statistics** of the weather.
* We can't directly compare to weather observations.
* Climate is changing fast.
* We can verify conservation laws, etc.
* We can analyze the behavior.
* We can compare statistics to observations.
* We can compare statistics to those of other models.

# Topics of this talk

* Analyzing the model itself.
* Direct comparison to reanalysis

# Analyzing the model itself {.section}

# Verifying conservation laws

# Verifying conservation laws
* Conservation of mass
  * Precipitation - evaporation
  * Ocean water and salt
* Conservation of energy
  * TOA radiation imbalance vs imbalance at surface
  * Ocean energy balance
  * Regional budgets are possible but messy regarding advection.

# Wind speed zonal mean section

Problem: The models have different vertical grids. The ICON output is on model levels, while (H)ERA is on pressure levels.


Solution: Vertical interpolation to the pressure levels of HERA.

# Climatologies
* The same day / month averaged across many years

Why would we do that?

# Climatologies
* The same day / month averaged across many years
* Allows to study the annual cycle.
* Removes most of the interannual variability.

# The power of SMILE

Comparing a single model initial--condition large ensemble to observations

* Tackles the problem of variability by providing an envelope of runs.
* Standard in weather forecasting.
* Many identical simulations with slightly varying initial conditions
* Ideally, for a long-running ensemble, reality should sometimes be at the upper end, sometimes at the lower end, and most times somewhere within the zoo of simulations. 
* see [Hamill, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129%3C0550:IORHFV%3E2.0.CO;2); [Suarez-Gutierrez, Milinski, Maher, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-021-05821-w) for details.

# Comparing to other simulations with the same or other models

* Shows outliers that call for more attention.
* Gives an estimate of certainty in simulations.
* Can show agreement because of common biases.
